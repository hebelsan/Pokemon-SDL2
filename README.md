# Pokemon-SDL2
<p>This is an attempt to make Pokemon great again, since it seems that Nintendo or 
Gamefreak do not have interest in making good Pokemon games anymore...</p>
<p>Everything is written in C++ and SDL2 is used to provide low level access to audio, keyboard and graphics.
The purpose of this project was to learn how to write a basic 2D game engine.
Since I wrote the code in my fith semester of computer science the code quality is not great.
Still I'm proud of what I achieved and I think others can learn from it, too.</p>

## How to run
```bash
./build.sh && ./build/pokemon
```
